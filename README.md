## What is OpenCVE?

OpenCVE is an open-source platform that helps you **monitor and manage** CVEs efficiently.

It aggregates vulnerabilities from **multiple sources** (MITRE, NVD, RedHat, Vulnrichment...) and lets you filter, track, and organize them by vendor, product, severity, and more.

You can subscribe to products, receive alerts, analyze changes, and collaborate with your team — all through a simple and powerful interface.
